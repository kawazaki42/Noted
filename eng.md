### 10 sentences about future vacation


I believe my next summer will be mostly like the last one.

I don't enjoy going outdoors, so I'll also spend most time at home.

Probably our family will go to KFC once, but it's not very likely.

We'll have a summer practice, so I think I'll learn a new language.

I like writing programs, but don't like to work with documents.

So I'll probably leave my practice report for autumn again.

My birthday is in the very end of summer, on August, 29.

As a birthday present, probably I'll get some digital stuff to help me study, or just for fun.

There is a tradition that we have pizza and watermelon on my birthday.

It's because I don't like cakes and other sweet food very much.

I also hope to have a good (or at least not too bad) rest from study.
