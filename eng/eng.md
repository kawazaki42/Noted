### 10 sentences about future vacation


I believe my next summer will be mostly like the last one.

I don't enjoy going outdoors, so I'll also spend most time at home.

Probably our family will go to KFC once, but it's not very likely.

We'll have a summer practice, so I think I'll learn a new language.

I like writing programs, but don't like to work with documents.

So I'll probably leave my practice report for autumn again.

My birthday is in the very end of summer, on August, 29.

As a birthday present, probably I'll get some digital stuff to help me study, or just for fun.

There is a tradition that we have pizza and watermelon on my birthday.

It's because I don't like cakes and other sweet food very much.

I also hope to have a good (or at least not too bad) rest from study.

<!-- VSCode + GFM is awesomeeeeeee -->

### Ten Myths about Robots

#### 1 Robots will take away jobs from people.

The article primarily sees robots as assistants on factories.

It mentions that humans will take the quality assurance and control parts in manufacturing.

But I disagree with the article's point of view.

Manual labor will be done by robots.

This might be good news because it's often hard and dangerous.

But employees won't get salary if their job can be done by a robot which is less expensive.

#### 2 Robots are expensive

The article states that they currently are, but in the future, thanks to technological development, they'll become more affordable.

Personally, I agree with this point of view.

Today we have more computing power in our pockets than early computer engineers had in specialized buildings.

As the article says, devices for mechanical work (_actuators_) aren't decreasing in price as much as sensors and processors do.

But technology develops rapidly, so I believe it might be possible to overcome this issue.

#### 3 High-level operations are what robots are supposedly used (_for?_)

(Meaning they aren't flexible _?_)

The article states that robots are able to be reprogrammed and rebuilt for a different purpose.

Generally, I agree with that, but it depends highly on the manufacturer.

A company may wish to increase its income by making its customers to buy separate devices for different tasks,
even through they could've been carried out by a single device.

Sadly, it's common today in computer systems.

#### 4 The programming in robots is hard because of how complex they are

The article states that it's possible to 'teach' a robot or, more precisely, 'fine-tune'
its movements rather than programming them ahead-of-time.

Well, it's a good technique that allows faster installation of robotic systems.

Another mentioned approach is using modelling, which may also be reasonable.

Personally, I always thought that programming in robots, like in microcontrollers
and other embedded systems involved
low-level control, possible in languages like ARM assembly, C or C++.

But if information in the text is true, it changes my world!

But, as the myth #2 is still true, there's no possibility for me to test it out...

#### 5 Robot systems are complex, and the programs are difficult to support

The text states that robots are more reliable than other factory machines,
most possibly meaning devices not designed for jobs involving mechanical movement.

Well, as for me, it's hard to believe.

There's so many parameters that need to be accounted.

Moreover, movable parts are not usually as durable as cameras or logic components,
and are currently more expensive.

But regarding programming, they are really more stable here.

They have a single task, so there's little things that can go wrong on the software level.

#### 6 Robots do whatever I tell them to do

(Meaning voice and, probably, text commands)

The article says that automation is more common than voice control in robots.

I agree with that.

Natural language processing and especially speech recognition
are tasks that are separate from the robot's operation, so in
manufacturing contexts, it's probably better to program them directly.

#### 7 Robots are machines built to look like a human

Absolutely a myth.

If automated response programs (bots) can be considered robots on their own,
they don't even represent a machine to begin with!

The article gives a dictionary defenition of a robot as an anthropomorphic machine,
but overall it states that the robot's functionality defines its design.

Some robots are given such traits though.

#### 8 Robots are strong but they are not agile

The article mentions an experiment with eggs, paper, and 80 times weight of a robot,
which proves that myth wrong.

Personally, I agree with the arcticle on that topic.

It shows that robots are able to be taught nearly everything.

#### 9 Robots are smart, but they cannot determine intent

Again, it depends on the particular model.

Some robots are designed for simply assembling two parts together.

But when you speak about AI, ANNs, big data and such,
I believe they are really smarter than humans and are cabable of 'self-awareness'.

The article contains similar thoughts.

#### 10 Robots can learn, but they cannot be self-evolved

The article mentions a robot that was able to self-evolve while 3D-printing
a new version of itself.

There is even a quote about AI creating products!

What a meta-level!

I also tend to believe they're better students than we are...

But that also gives a dystopian feeling about some kind of machine wars,
similar to that in sci-fi films such as The Terminator and the like.

You know, I wish the best to machines, but don't want to see them rule by using brute force.

attach itself to other programs.
