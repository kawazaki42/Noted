Good evening. I'm a second-year student at the Transbaikal State University
majoring in Informaton Technology and Computer Science.

Today I am going to tell you about my project on formatting data for
students' timetable.

Let's first talk about why I began working on this project at all.

If you look at the slide, you'll see the timetable used on the website of
our university.

It's convenient to have one, however,
it's often found to have some design flaws.

For example, the law of proximity states that spacing between groups should
be bigger than the items within them.

Also, we may notice that there's informational and visual noise.
For instance, columns for the lecturer and for lecturer's department are not
as important as the classroom when you need to look at the table quickly.

There are empty rows that on the one hand may act as kind of spacing, but
cells' borders worsen readability.

So, how can we fix that?

The most straighforward way is to use an API
(Application Programming Interface).
